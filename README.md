Rachel's Path to Restoration: A Theological Forecasting Model
# Rachel's Path to Restoration: A Theological Forecasting Model

## Overview

This is a private, nerdy, deeply affectionate forecasting model created as a gift for a close friend. It calculates the probability that I (Rachel) will convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and estimates when this might occur.

**Important disclaimers:**
- This is NOT meant to mock religion or reduce sacred questions to mere statistics
- This IS meant to show how seriously I'm taking this exploration
- The model uses real theological barriers, lived experiences, and yes, some playful metrics (herbal tea sessions count, apparently)
- This represents months of genuine conversation, scripture reading, and spiritual wrestling

## Methodology

The model employs a weighted Bayesian approach where each variable contributes to an overall conversion probability. Variables include theological barriers (grace vs. works, additional scripture comfort), life factors (family concerns, community proximity), witness exposure (lived faith observation hours), key spiritual events, and... the late-night Book of Mormon reading count.

Think of this as a dashboard for a sincere faith journey, built by someone who takes both data and discipleship seriously.

## Variables

### Theological Barriers (4 variables)
- **Coffee Dependency Index**: Lifestyle barrier - coffee is life
- **Grace vs. Works Gap**: Fundamental doctrinal difference between Evangelical and LDS theology
- **Additional Scripture Comfort Level**: Openness to revealed scripture beyond the Bible
- **Salvation Timeline Preference Gap**: Moment-in-time salvation vs. process/ordinances

### Life Factors (3 variables)
- **Family Reaction Concern**: Impact of potential family disappointment
- **Personal Life Event That Forces Eternal Considerations**: Major life events that prompt theological reflection
- **Community Proximity Requirement, Specific Friend Included**: Need for personal connection within ward community

### Witness & Engagement (3 variables)
- **Lived Faith Witness Exposure Hours**: Time spent observing authentic faith in action
- **Theological Conversation Frequency**: Regular deep discussions about faith
- **Scripture Reading Progress**: Commitment to reading Book of Mormon and Doctrine & Covenants

### Key Events (2 binary variables)
- **Attended Church Event by Invitation**: Threshold-crossing moment of participation
- **Holy Spirit Instigated Event Factor**: Divine intervention moments

### Playful Metrics (3 variables)
- **Herbal Tea Sessions per Month**: Bonding rituals over tea (the irony!)
- **Spiritual Meme Exchange Rate**: Regular sharing of faith-related content
- **Late-Night Scripture Reading Incidents**: Post-midnight Book of Mormon chapters

## Scenario Modeling

The model includes three "what-if" scenarios:
1. **What if coffee wasn't a factor?** - Removes the lifestyle barrier
2. **What if family was fully supportive?** - Eliminates family concern
3. **Grace/Works Question Internally Resolved** - Theological breakthrough

## How to Use

Adjust the sliders and toggles to see how different factors affect the conversion probability in real-time. The model updates dynamically and provides:
- Current probability percentage
- Projected timeline
- Factor contribution breakdown

## Technical Details

Built with:
- React for interactive UI
- Real-time Bayesian probability calculations
- Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile
- ADHD-friendly visual hierarchy with color-coding

## Notes

Some variables decrease in weight as probability increases (e.g., community proximity requirement becomes less of a barrier once the decision is made). This reflects the reality that certain factors matter more during exploration than after commitment.

The projected timeline uses probability thresholds:
- <20%: Timeline uncertain
- 20-40%: Q4 2027 - Q2 2028
- 40-60%: Q2 2026 - Q4 2026
- 60-80%: Q3 2025 - Q1 2026
- 80%+: Q1 2025 - Q2 2025
